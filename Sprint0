Project Manager: Nellie Zhang
Scrum Master: Blair Jia

Draft Goal: want to make sure we are creating equity across all students, properly convey areas of knowledge mastery as well as highlight improvement areas

Potential areas to move toward: cheating/academic honesty, how would users (students and teachers) access this information, gamification,
once you have met a certain learning goal, you will get less questions on that learning goal

Features: Individual accounts with a log-in page, using in and out of the classroom (more study aid than quiz deployment), tracking proficency based on
quizes, teacher can see how all students are progressing

Stakeholders/Users: Professors, TAs, tutors, graders (all departments)
- tailor this by grading models (reflective approach, constraint based, satisfaction models, core competency approach)

Areas of simplification: professors and graders/tas/tutors all have the same access, things are autograder, learning goals as checkpoints, tracker won't
be used for grades, more of an ungrading model

User stories: As a professor, I want to be able to track how my students are progressing toward the learning goals.

As a professor, I want to know how my students are performing compared to the rest of the class.

As a professor, I want to be able to set learning goals and upload questions that meet the learning goals.

From Professor Andrews: committed to non-grade based approach, either overall reflective approach or core competency approach (binary). Students get a
custom quiz depending on where they are in completeing their learning goals. Keep track of where assignments are. Reflection based, ability to revise. I 
want to know which specific questions students are continually getting wrong. 

Epic user stories: As a professor, I want to be able to track how my students are progressing toward the learning goals so that I can ....
