## Discussion

### User stories

I am not seeing much in the way of user stories in either the completed tasks or the sprint 2 backlog. On the other hand, I do see tasks like "professor view functionality". This is so vague and unspecified that it is impossible to complete as it stands. You have some reasonable user stories in the project, but they need to be connected to the work items. You should also think about adding in acceptance criteria to both your user stories and your tasks so you know when they are done.

### Agility/scrum

The commits seem to be a little bursty. I would work on maintaining a more consistent velocity. I also see that Danzan is overly represented in the git log. It would be good for the rest of the team to be making commits.

### Integration

I am seeing reasonable PR activity, with at least the appearance of multiple eyes on the changes. Make sure that you are actually reviewing the code. If need be, look back over the lecture notes on reviewing code.

### Implementation

The implementation is shaping up okay, but there is a complete lack of meaningful tests.

I also think you should think out your page routing scheme a little more. You have duplicated the Simplepedia scheme, but I don't know that that is required (or desired) here. Will there really be a need for catchall routes like this? Will results really be displayed at /quizresults/:id? What will the id refer to?

### Functionality

I think you made the right choice focusing on getting a single quiz visible. I am concerned however, by the amount yuo have left to do. Make sure you are keeping an eye on the amount of time left. It would be better to scale back now and have something solid by the end rather than something that is only half done.
